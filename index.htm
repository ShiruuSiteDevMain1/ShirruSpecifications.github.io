<h>Beta V0.0.1 Site
This is a test version at the moment
It will most likely have beta testing on here like a chat room and different branches on the site leading to other sections of the site
For now, this project/site does not have much added nor much people working on it at the current state, this will soon change though.
From the main lead Developer, aka DevINF.
The date at the moment is March 5th, 2024 on a Tuesday.</h>
